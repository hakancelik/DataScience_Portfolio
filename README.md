## Project Structure

In all of my data science and machine learning projects, I have adopted a consistent folder structure to ensure organization and clarity. This structure helps to separate different components of each project and facilitates collaboration and maintenance. Below is an overview of the folder organization:

```
projects/

│   │   ├── dashboards/            # Tableau dashboard files
│   │   └── reports/               # Tableau reports
│   │
│   ├── reports/                 # General reports and visualizations
│   │   ├── final_report.pdf        # Final report
│   │   └── exploratory_report.md    # Exploratory report
│   │
│   ├── images/                  # Folder for images
│   │   ├── data_analysis_example.png # Example image for data analysis
│   │   └── project_overview.png   # Project overview image
│   │
│   ├── environment.yml          # Python environment dependencies (if using Conda)
│   ├── requirements.txt         # Python dependencies (if using pip)
│   ├── README.md                # Project information
│   └── .gitignore               # Git ignore file
```



This structure not only improves the readability of my projects but also makes it easier for others to navigate through the various components. You can find individual projects under the `projects/` folder, each containing its own set of data, scripts, and reports.
